# Rectangle
This is an assignment from one of my introductory computer science courses in Java. 
The "Rectangle.java" class simply allows the user to create rectangles of various sizes, as well as letting the user know when the dimensions they provided for a rectangle are not proper. (i. e. not negative lengths). Additionally, the "RectangleTest.java" file is utilized to make sure that the rectangle class is working as anticipated.
